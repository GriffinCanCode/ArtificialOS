## Quick Navigation

### Getting Started
1. Start with [`architecture/system-architecture.md`](architecture/system-architecture.md)
2. Review [`patterns/code-standards.md`](patterns/code-standards.md)
3. Explore specific features in [`/features`](features/)

### For Contributors
- Read [`patterns/code-standards.md`](patterns/code-standards.md) for coding guidelines
- Check [`planning/implementation-guide.md`](planning/implementation-guide.md) for implementation details
- Review relevant feature docs in [`/features`](features/)

### For App Developers
- Start with [`apps/native-apps-dev-guide.md`](apps/native-apps-dev-guide.md)
- Read [`architecture/blueprint-dsl.md`](architecture/blueprint-dsl.md)
- Check [`ui-frontend/cva-setup.md`](ui-frontend/cva-setup.md) for UI components

### For Performance Tuning
- Review [`performance/advanced-optimizations.md`](performance/advanced-optimizations.md)
- Check [`patterns/sharded-slot.md`](patterns/sharded-slot.md) for lock-free patterns
- See [`performance/bincode-optimization.md`](performance/bincode-optimization.md) for serialization

## Documentation Standards

### Naming Conventions
- **Folders**: lowercase with hyphens (e.g., `ui-frontend`, `performance`)
- **Files**: lowercase with hyphens (e.g., `system-architecture.md`, `code-standards.md`)

### File Structure
Each documentation file should include:
- Overview section at the top
- Clear headings and subheadings
- Code examples where applicable
- Cross-references to related documents

### Cross-References
When referencing other docs, use relative paths:
```markdown
See [System Architecture](architecture/system-architecture.md) for details.
```

## Migration Notes

**Previous Structure** → **New Structure**

- `ARCHITECTURE.md` → `architecture/system-architecture.md`
- `CODE_STANDARDS_2025.md` → `patterns/code-standards.md`
- `NATIVE_APPS_DEV_GUIDE.md` → `apps/native-apps-dev-guide.md`
- `FUTURE_IDEAS.md` → `planning/future-ideas.md`
- *(All files reorganized with consistent naming)*

## Contributing to Docs

When adding new documentation:
